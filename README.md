hydra üôè p5.js live-coding library!

## USAGE
Visit [HY5LIVE](https://hy5live.teddavis.org), to play with it right away! A minimal live-coding editor built for HY5.

Include it within any project by first including hydra-synth + p5.js, then attach this file (download or CDN):

```html
<script src='https://unpkg.com/hydra-synth'></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.9.0/p5.min.js"></script>

## ABOUT
[HY5](https://github.com/ffd8/hy5) bridges the gap between [hydra-synth](https://github.com/hydra-synth/hydra-synth) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org), containing a suite of functions for passing visuals between both frameworks (`hydra` ¬ª `p5` || `p5` ¬ª `hydra`), while enabling global-mode code within both! 

*FYI, global-mode refers to functions of each library being used without a scoped prefix (ie. `p.` or `synth.`) which is commonly used when combining multiple libraries to avoid naming conflicts (ie. both have a `noise()` function). While scoping avoids conflicts, it requires lots of extra characters and easily trips one up when only sometimes being necessary (ie, chaining).*  

HY5 started as [HY5LIVE](https://hy5live.teddavis.org), but partway through, realized that this bridge could be separated as a library of its own to easily embed anywhere. 

FYI ‚Äì this workflow involves multiple fullscreen HTML5 Canvas elements, so a chromium browser is recommended. If performance is low, reduce the resolution using p5's `pixelDensity()` and `H.pixelDensity()` for hydra.

For more in-depth live-coding specific to each framework, see:

## API
### Overview
Under the hood, HY5 creates a few global variables (`HY5`, `P5`, `H`) which are your keys for talking to each framework's canvas and bridging the gap between p5.js and hydra:
 
- `HY5` stores delay prefs (for checking canvas ready) and inits `H` instances.
- `P5` affects p5.js and canvas.
- `H` affects hydra and canvas.  
*It's a class, allowing multiple hydras for post-post-processing?! Details below.*

### P5
*p5.js specific ‚Äì mostly used in the global code space (not within other functions).*

**P5.init()**  
**P5.init( [ source, layer ] )**  
Send p5.js canvas/layer as a hydra source. If no values are set, takes main p5.js canvas and sets hydra's `s0` external source. Use `src(s0).out()` to access it within hydra. Optionally pass it to a specific hydra source (s0, s1, s2, s3). Optionally you can also send another p5.js layer/image. If passing the p5.js webcam capture, use `capture.get()` to dynamically convert to a passible image.  
Without params, (`s0`, `drawingContext.canvas`)

**P5.hide()**  
Hide p5.js canvas.

**P5.show()**  
Show p5.js canvas.

**P5.zIndex()**  
**P5.zIndex( [index] )**  
Set css `z-index` of p5.js canvas to place in front or behind hydra.  
Without params, (`-1`) to place behind other canvases.

**P5.z()**  
**P5.z( [index] )**  
Alias of P5.zIndex()


### H
*hydra specific ‚Äì used within hydra chains, p5.js draw(), global space.*

**noize()**  
Alias of hydra's `noise()` to avoid p5's `noise()` conflict.


**H.pixelDensity()**  
**H.pixelDensity( [res] )**  
Set pixelDensity of hydra canvas (similar to p5.js). Use for lo/hi-res.  
Without params, (2.0) for retina resolution

**H.pd()**  
**H.pd( [res] )**  
Alias of H.pixelDensity()

**H.get()**  
**H.get( [layer] )**  
**H.get( [output] )**  
**H.get( [output], [layer] )**  
Get hydra canvas and set to a p5 layer (`createGraphics`). You can pass an existing p5 layer or a string for dynamically created one, ie. `H.get('tex')`. Passing a hydra output as param (`o0`, `o1`, `o2`, `o3`), it will grab that single output if hydra is set to `render()` (4up view). If both params are given, it will grab a specific hydra output and use a custom layer, ie. `H.getOutput(o2, 'tex2')`.   
Without params, creates layer called `h0`.

**H.render()**  
**H.render( [prefix] )**  
**H.render( [output] )**  
**H.render( [output, layer] )**  
Draw all hydra outputs (`o0`, `o1`, `o2`, `o3`) to p5 layers, *only* when hydra's `render()` (4up view) is active. This creates 4x p5.js layers (`h0`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3` and `h[0-3]` for looped index access). If `output` is given a string prefix, ie. `tex`, then all outputs will be created with a custom prefix (`tex` instead of `h`). If `output` is given a hydra output (ie. `o2`), will draw specific hydra output to default `h0` layer (similar to `H.get()`, however in same syntax as hydra's `render(output)`.  If layer is also given, will draw specific hydra output to specific p5.js layer.  
Without params, grabs `o0-o3` and creates layers called `h0-h3`.

**H.getCanvas(canvas, layer)**  
Draw any canvas to a p5 layer. *(go wild?!)*

**H.save()**  
Save png of hydra canvas.

**H.hide()**  
Hide hydra canvas.

**H.show()**  
Show hydra canvas.

**H.zIndex()**  
**H.zIndex( [index] )**  
Set css `z-index` of hydra canvas to place in front or behind p5.    
Without params, (`-1`) to place behind other canvases.

**H.z()**  
**H.z( [index] )**  
Alias of H.zIndex()

**H.audio()**  
**H.audio(toggle)**  
Enable/disable hydra audio detection. This is active by default, however if you prefer to use p5.sound, set to false, ie `H.audio(false)`.  
Without param, `true`

**H.noSmooth()**  
**H.noSmooth(toggle)**  
Enable/disable `noSmooth()` when setting hydra to p5.js layers. This is active by default for crisp (nearest neighbor) edges, however you can set to false, ie `H.noSmooth(false)`.  
Without param, `true`

**H.canvas()**  
Alias of `hydra.canvas` for quick access.

### HY5
*Ignore this section except for advanced use.*  

**HY5.delay(newDelay)**
Set cusom `setTimeout()` delay (default is 100 ms) necessary when referring to dynamically built canvases in further functions below. Default delay worked fine in testing (M1 Mac), but if computer/connection is slower, you may want to set to higher value (in milliseconds).

**HY5.hydra(hydraName, synthName)**
Create an additional instance of hydra (canvas and synth scoped) for post-post-...-processing! This function has already been called once, setting the global variable `H` (see below). Only needed for extra-wild experiments, see demos for details.
